## Building a Weather Mood Tracker App with Streamlit: A Step-by-Step Guide
### Introduction:
In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of creating a Weather Mood Tracker app using Streamlit, a powerful Python library for building interactive web applications. Our app will analyze weather data and its impact on mood, providing valuable insights and visualizations. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a functional app that can help you understand how weather affects your mood. So, let's dive in!

### Introduction to Streamlit
Streamlit is a Python library that makes it easy to create and share interactive web apps for data science and machine learning projects. It allows developers to build beautiful and intuitive user interfaces with minimal code. Streamlit's simplicity and versatility make it an ideal choice for our Weather Mood Tracker app.

### Setting Up the Development Environment
Before we begin, let's set up our development environment. Make sure you have Python and pip installed on your machine. Open a terminal or command prompt and create a new virtual environment:
```
python -m venv weather-mood-tracker-env
```
Activate the virtual environment:

* For Windows:
```weather-mood-tracker-env\Scripts\activate
```
* For macOS/Linux:
```source weather-mood-tracker-env/bin/activate
```
Next, install the required libraries by executing the following command:
```pip install streamlit pandas scikit-learn plotly```
Or using requirements file:
``` pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt```
